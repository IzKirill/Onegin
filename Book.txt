     A backward look is fraught with danger;
     a ball here, there a children's party;
     a ball in Petersburg; but fun
     A ball: the joy of every guest!
     a blank default would suit me better.
     a book of household calculations,
     a carving-knife -- and in the tangle
     a cheerful glimmer on the snow
     a corpse on boards was all he found,
     a crayfish rides on spider-back;
     a deathless murmur from within,
     a deft arrangement to his hair,
     a dog with horns, a goatee'd witch,
     a dream's mute monument, reflection
     a dumb moon, on a dumb horizon.''
     a dwarf with tail, and a half-strain,
     a flimsy bridge whose every quake
     a flood on which no frosty band
     a fop, a punter on the cards,
     a frequent question: ``tell me who
     a furious, boiling, heaving main
     a grammar, a digest of fable,
     a great attraction to conversing.
     a group of monsters round a table,
     a gulf has gaped... Says Tanya: ``I
     a haze in me, but I grew used
     a hermit's life -- he'd be proceeding
     a hidden beauty in the end:
     a hideous deal of tribulation.
     ``A humble sinner, Dimitry Larin,
     a hundred times afresh distorted;
     a hybrid cross of cat and crane.
     a joking flirt, or both together,
     a lady -- what a grim discussion! --
     a lyre, and on it perched, a dove --
     a madrigal for epitaph.
     A man who's active and incisive
     a marksman crouching in the green.
     a masculine disguise to aid
     a mild rebuke was his worst mark,
     a modish taste, a dowdy touch --
     a nation's wealth is, what augments it,
     a nightingale, in forest gloom,
     a novel graced with such a name.
     a novel in Lafontaine's8 manner...
     a novel on the established line
     a park, enormous and neglected,
     a passer-by; and on tiptoe
     a place for rest. Eugene alone
     a plain, unceremonious troop,
     a poet, and a Kantian sage.
     a portrait with a charming touch;
     a pretty girl exactly like
     a quilted chamber-robe and cap.
     a raging torrent, capped with breakers,
     a rambling walk beside my lake,
     a red-foot goose, weight something fearful,
     a rooster head, and on the twitch
     a Russian family's old traditions;
     a saucy kibítka is slicing
     a scream rings out... the cabin's quaking...
     a seedling fallen in the earth.
     a sham that trustful souls work out;
     a shambling hoof along the way;
     a sharp-nailed paw towards her; bracing
     (a simile of this and that)
     a simple Russian family night:
     a skeleton jerked by a cable,
     A sorry state of things, it's true!
     a soul of sympathy and grace,
     a soul so innocent, so trusting.
     a soul that nothing can renew...
     a spirit strange, a spirit burning,
     a stanza villainously padded.
     a steed responsive to the bridle,
     a story that still wants completing;
     a stride on Petrarch's path, allayed
     A sudden clatter!... blood was curdled...
     a suite of elegies that, throbbing,
     A thinker in a desert mission,
     A thought was born, and quickly noted...
     a tomb, a Cyprian shrine's invented,
     a true companion to the end,
     a truly noble disposition;
     a wondrous tenderness. And whether
     a young girl's looking-glass is kept.
     ``Abandon hope for evermore.''9
     about one thing, till our next meeting.
     about them -- nineteen to the dozen --
     about what's buried in the past:
     above the dust of his remains
     above the water started tracing
     absorbed me in the recollection
     accounts, shaved forelocks,4 Sunday bath;
     across each bush, across each steep,
     across our snows of northern bleakness
     across the Baltic in exchange
     across the drift-encumbered acres,
     across the public's toes; he steers
     across the stage; he yawns: ``Ballet --
     across the years to our own time.
     add vale when he signed a letter;
     addressed to Onegin''... ...'Well, that's easy.
     addressed to Tanya, certain verses
     adore the love that comes in dream.
     adorned the sanctum of our sage.
     adorning all its country ways.
     advises him of dinner-time.
     After a fine career, his father
     after that, supper's served, and so
     after two minutes, off again,
     again I see your soulful flight?
     against each other swift, small feet.
     ages we'd never heard of love:
     Agree, the way Eugene proceeded
     Ah, gently, gently, easy goes --
     Ah, he had loved a love that never
     Ahead of them a pinewood slumbers
     ``Akulka'' the onetime Selina,
     alarmed by my melodious lay,
     Alas! the generations must,
     Alas, it's not so hard to guess!
     Alas, on pleasure's wild variety
     (alas, too salted); now they're bringing
     album and stays, Princess Alina,
     all a pure maiden's love was breathing.
     All are dumbfounded. Lensky shies
     all blend into Eugene alone.
     all brought to life at your direction.
     all day, all night, his presence fills her,
     All flourishing; they send their duty.
     all for our tender dreamy maiden
     all in a blaze, I said: it's he!
     all plunged his soul deep in the stream
     all point at her, and all combine
     ``All right, I'll come then...'' ``What a friend!''
     All right, you want the resurrection
     all shout and argue, laugh and squeak.
     All sleep: from the saloon a roaring
     all stand. He walks towards the door.
     all these are charming! but to put
     All this has now gone out of fashion,
     all this, at eighteen years of age,
     all was material for transcribing:
     almost as good as a dim lamp.
     Alone amid all his possessions,
     alone with him; Onegin takes her
     alone, and sunk in calculation,
     Along the fronts of darkened houses,
     along the street where slumber drowses,
     already high in treason's league!
     Already Olga's hand was gripping
     already she'd assume ill-luck.
     already silvering all the plain...
     already stirred him as they should.
     already studying to intrigue,
     already tends too much to smile
     already yawned before the show,
     Already, in exultant fashion,
     although it's nearly heard the knell,
     although there are no streets, no cards,
     always before the volume ended
     always contented with his life,
     always monotonously gay,
     Always our fervid hero tended
     am always glad to write, it's true,
     am doomed to perish, yet to die
     among the guests a general dinning:
     among the guests she recognized
     among the neighbours round about.
     amusing, flattering with the best,
     an album's loose and floating sheaves.
     an eloquence of fevered strength,
     an ode in twenty-five cantos.
     an offering ready for the ground.
     an urge to sleep; soon, clear as clear,
     ancestral1 portraits met the view
     and ``what's your name?'' she asks him, speaking
     and act the humble or imperious,
     and after jealousy's grim weather
     and all into the salon squeeze,
     and all is lost beyond retrieving;
     and all our modish education;
     and all the neighbours planned a match
     And all the while the moon was shining
     and all the world is buried deep.
     and all their ravishing invention
     and almost swoons, and almost dies.
     and although Troy's greybeards, collected
     and always the inspired regard --
     and always the self-same objection;
     and ananas, the gold of trees.
     and arm in arm they all go through;
     and at the very self-same time
     and autumn lingered, long and slow;
     and band already tired of blowing,
     and beat a nacreous wing when caught

     and counsellor (retired) Flyánov,
     and country stillness: there the lyre
     and crisply crunch the morning snow.
     and dead ideas from that old hoard,
     and dinner with a touch of idle
     and duck get up; with instant timing,
     and Dunya works the samovar;

     And Eugene? half-awake, half-drowsing,
     and evening now drew on in mist...
     and every day its own enjoyment?
     and every man won't understand it
     And every morning I awake
     and every night shares her repose.
     and everything around was dreaming,
     and everything is cramped and loud;
     and faithful wife I'd have been cast.
     and fastens, like a term of art,
     and fatherland and grim confinement?

     and for her cheeks to cease their blushing;

     and frames would shudder, windows tremble;
     and friends and friendship, soul-destroying;

     and from within come noise and cheer;

     and health, life's sweetness and its shimmer,
     and heart so tender, it can still

     and held him briefly in their sway,
     And here my sentiments impel me
     and hid the bookshelf's dusty stack
     and hills that delicately winter
     And home was now their destination;
     and how a country lives, and why
     and how's Tatyana? Olga too,

     and not because she'd once preferred
     And not because she'd read him, either,
     and nothing pierced his senses' blur.
     and now a swooning mind attends me,
     and now at last he saw the World.
     and now it's Bordeaux the Judicious
     and now the crunchy snow is stripping
     And now there's gradually beginning
     And now, monotonously dashing
     And now, my friends, I hear from you

     and pay my debt in the same coin
     and pledged to you, and firmly planned:

     and satisfied with what he'd got,
     and saved from being charmed or fooled!
     and scorned his fellows through and through,
     and sees... whatever do you think?
     and self-oblivion was his art!
     and set off prompter than a whistle
     and sets her gently on the floor.
     and she, submissively, inertly --
     and shout, and make room for the pair.
     and shouts suggest a crowded wake;
     and sideways her poor head is stooping.
     and sighs, and asks oneself all through:
     and sink to prose's humble level:
     and skids and tumbles down; the cheerful
     and slowly day begins to climb.
     and so in winter-fields will shiver
     And so they lived, two ageing mortals,
     and so your faithfullest supporter
     and so, before the world of learning,
     and some were even testifying
     And someone's heart will feel a quiver,
     and soon they bring her... a guitar
     and soon, oh soon the storm's arrears
     and stately periwigs, their fame.
     and stoves with tiles of various hue.
     and swaggers in a red calpack;
     and take due warning from my speech.
     and tea and supper; there's an inner
     and tea's brought in. Instead of chimes
     and tears were drowning her regard.
     and tedious means to festive ends.
     and tell of children's plighted playing
     and telling trochee from iambic
     and the blancmanger, then a fleet
     and the derivative Knyazhnín:8
     and the majestic, antlered royal,
     and the Skotínins, grizzled sages,
     And the sly baseness, fit to throttle,
     and theirs was the poetic flame
     and then a boat, with oars a-swinging,
     and then a drozhky's clopping sound
     and then a stroll in Letny Park.
     and then it's tea that comes to mention,
     and then sat silent all the way.
     and then, indoors the livelong day,

     and though perhaps old fires were thrusting
     and though to do so would be daring,

     and washed its face, to her brought word
     and wasted life's fine flower meanwhile.
     and watch your daughters closer yet,
     and Werther, martyred and doom-laden,
     and what came out? a hairy, tumbled,
     And what's more, they're so supercilious,
     and when its waters were not showing,
     and when, by misty moon, the east
     and where most surely notes are sped.
     and where the husband, recognizing
     and while the star still flew, she'd hurry
     and whiskers -- all of this it keeps
     and whisper ``Dunya, pay attention!''
     and whist, that's now so keenly fêted --
     and with a halting, trembling gait
     and with a yawn took up his pen,

     and with its feeble glow outlining

     as fresh as ever, for its graces
     as from their luscious hive go tumbling
     as gage of all things that were good,
     as gay as morning and as clear,
     as helpmeet in my sad existence,
     as horses whirled him through the dust.
     as I have... learn from my belief

     as if a cold hand squeezed her heart,
     As if before some mournful parting
     as if beneath her, dark and rumbling,
     as if some goal had been achieved.
     as infant sleep, or the unaffected
     as instituted long ago.''
     as it assembles them around;
     as love's technique, when it would blare
     as much as in Moscow the proud.
     as much of banquets and the cork
     as pair by pair the dancers fly.
     as sacred, lies before me still.
     as scarlet heels have lost their name
     As soon as he appears, discussion
     ``as sung of old, in years of glory,
     as was the old suspicious sage,
     as well-read, though of pedant cast.
     as yours did, Homer, godlike lord,
     as youthful sinning, or the strains
     As, lovingly, in his confession,
     at a friend's word, a girl's caress.
     at any hour escape his cell.''

     At first I thought it out of season
     at first Madame gave him tuition,
     At first Onegin's tongue produced
     At first they called; but on perceiving
     At first, disparity of heart
     at first, with God knows whom to see,
     at hours, which, why I cannot think,
     at least by a regretful kindness;
     at least her tone is sometimes found
     at my famed portrait and will say:
     at noontime does his horn resound
     at once they give a man the spleen.
     at soldier-husbands, and the drum.
     at sunken wax inside a bowl:
     at the Academic Diction-book.

     Away inside that unassuming

     Bards of our tearful generation,

     bear's gone; a hallway, no mistake;
     bear, blackness, blizzard, bridge and crow,
     became like brother knit to brother.
     became their scrutiny's concern.
     become a joke to us, its game,
     becomes a horse for all to see;
     bed-time, and time for guests to go.
     Beds are made up; the guests are all
     beds, bridges, lawn, she never stops,
     befitting such a noble pile:
     before him roast beef, red and gory,
     before it was the golden play
     before Onegin there collected
     before the fire a table's spread;
     before the window taking station,
     before which life's horizon yet
     begot by boredom out of greed.
     behind the door the clash of glasses
     Believe (as conscience is my warrant),
     believes in her elected dreaming
     below the others who have signed
     beneath it, vapour wreathed and coiled.
     Beneath storm's vestment, on the seaway,
     beneath the stone reposes here,
     beside his heavier half is snoring.
     beside unfinished lines, a suite
     between their girls and this half-Russian.
     Between them, every topic started
     bewitches Tanya... he is able
     beyond a doubt, its wondrous tracing
     beyond a string of dull tableaux,
     bidding us to reject for good
     billiards are dropped, cue put to bed:
     bitter-sweet glory's inspiration,
     blest the poor lover who reads out
     blest... though perhaps her fancy's caught
     blinded to everything about
     blooms when there's nothing else to do.
     blue smoke of chimneys goes aloft,
     boo Phaedra out as paralytic,
     Books, riding, walks, sleep heavy-laden,
     Bordeaux, you're like a faithful friend,
     bored by success' giddy trifle,
     bored with hilarity, and weary,
     boredom has just as sure an entry,
     ``Boredom, that's what so bad, my friend.''
     Boston and ombre for the old,
     both hearts to blaze had now expired;
     both set him yawning just as much.
     bottles to which some pitch is clinging:
     bound where the magic bow will send her,
     boy-tribes with skates on loudly slice
     breaking the lilac bushes, smashing
     breaks a new passage with his sleigh;
     bribe-taker, glutton and buffoon.
     bright summer days that passed so slowly,
     bring up a table, and a taper;
     brushes for teeth, brushes for nails.
     brushes on thirty different scales;
     Bubbles like Hippocrene are spraying;
     burst to a fiery blaze in season?
     bursts with cold envy and with bile?
     but all concurred that, truth to speak,
     but at the window, in the splendid
     but by and large their talk's a hash
     But dinner's served, so two by two
     But don't be cross, my darling friend,
     but Eugene's out from din and press:
     But ever stranger and more fearful:
     But finally she heaved a yearning
     but first, the dreams that hope can cherish
     But friendship, as between our heroes,
     but from her shaggy-liveried ranger
     but from our friends, good Lord protect us!
     But God, how deadly dull to sample
     but groomed an anecdote-collection
     But he, by sad and rocky ways,
     but held up by the simple fact
     but here we must control our mouth.
     but hold my tongue, lest it appears
     But how she jumped, when in this hovel
     But I myself read my bedizened
     but I refuse to chop or change.

     But it was passion that preempted
     but it's the first time you'll have known it,
     But it's the talent for concealing
     but just to make the bargain keener,
     but ladies' hands are not for kissing;

     but madrigals I've got to write!

     but never asked her husband first.
     But now Aurora's crimson fingers
     but now I've rather lost the art.
     but now it bores me every minute.
     but now my brain is darkened, Tanya:
     But now the radiance of the moon
     but now, thank God, you're well and steady,
     but Olga would have never read!
     But ours, whatever he might be,
     but pantaloons, waistcoat, and frock,
     but piteous he, the all-foreseeing,
     but scarcely understood a word.
     But soft! You hear? A scowling critic,
     but soon the ways we trod were parted
     but suddenly a snowdrift rumbled,
     ``But tell me, which one was Tatyana?''
     But that's enough. At once, in stead,
     But that's enough. My beauty's letter
     but then a sudden breeze surprises,
     ``But there'll be such a rout and scrabble
     But to the garden, to the scene
     But was it happy, his employment,
     But what about Eugene? With reason
     but when past joking he fell sick,
     But when the hour of youthful passion
     but where are all your evenings spent?''
     but wildly still her heart is rushing,
     but will, and reason's strong constraint,
     But you perhaps find no attraction
     but you're not paying any heed.''
     But you're not sociable, they say:
     But you, blest husbands, to the end
     But you, grand tomes I loathe with passion,
     but your vile Helen's not my star --
     But, did they not corrupt society,
     ``But, if you've kept some faint impression
     But, in a fearful huff, his thrifty
     but, inside brackets, I'm contending

     by any itch for marriage ties;

     by country freedom, rightful pardon
     by decent company, has not,

     By dire presentiment awestruck,

     By now whist's heroes have completed
     by pain and languishment; she craved
     by Scott, by Seneca, or Byron,
     by sighs of passion or by praise.
     by six-page letters, rings and tears,
     by some perverse schoolboy for sport;
     by the cold world's corrupt finesse;
     ``By virtue of procrastinating
     by way of secret tome that slept

     Eugene attends the boulevard,
     Eugene had no wish to betray
     Eugene has caught up, quick as quick,
     Eugene takes Olga, and is gone;
     Eugene turned countryman. He tasted
     Eugene was free, and as a dresser
     Eugene would willingly have started
     Eugene's a pedant in his dress,

     eyes rolling, arms uplifted, furious,
     facing a belle I loved with passion,
     fades from the view, and in the hush
     fancies once more are hotly bubbling,
     fancies, my rhythmic search for truth,
     fancy, a wine serene in mood,

     Fate saved Evgeny from perdition:

     feeling is quaint, and fit for fools.
     feeling to what had long been heartless:
     feelings he valued -- from outside.
     felicitously every theme,
     fever of rhyme: thereby he's doubled
     fieldward, in noisy swarm, the bees.
     fieldwork directed from the path,
     filled him with thoughts that swarmed and whirred;
     finding in that no deprivation --
     fir, forest, hedgehog, raven, snow
     fire of the cutlets' scalding fat,
     Fired by the god of inspiration,
     first flakes of snow whirl round and sink
     first, we'll take vanity, and let

     for quite a while by fortune's hand.
     for raking up historic dust
     for Satan, love's a splendid joke.
     For several days she peaked and pined
     for shame and fear my wits are sliding...
     for she was bored by laughs and noise
     For such am I. When you were speaking
     for the footlights, this fickle traitor
     for the sublime, and for the passions
     for them by fathers who, as friends
     for them, in Butterweek5 the greaseful,
     for unmeant kindness -- how he shone!
     for us are instruments and tools;
     for whom, to expiate your crimes,
     for witty; in his Gallic way
     for wood and tallow; all the range
     for you have, at this early date,
     for your enlightenment to say
     for, mistress-like, it's brilliant, vain,

     fortunate one, he'd not disgrace;

     found that in laughter yawns could stifle:
     fragments of poems from the North,
     fraught with enticement and disaster?
     Freed from its dripping cork, the bottle
     freedom's enthusiastic dream,
     frenzy which wrecks our lives for sound,
     fresh as a poppy-flower, your face.''
     fresh from the cot, an infant pickle,
     fresh leaves... for such is heaven's mandate.

     from off her charming shoulder's drooping,
     from table, clattering on the floor;
     From that rough spell at last exempted,
     from the agent, with this tale to tell:
     from thirty down to two; and stop,

     From widow Clicquot and from Moët,

     haphazard; so, to God be thanks,
     Happy a hundredfold, whoever
     Happy is he who's known its fretful
     harboured by maidens of thirteen!
     has come with Kharlikov; he passes
     has driven off, to find his own.
     has gone to Olga, swept the girl
     has hardly mastered postal prose.
     has made the park her brooding-place,
     has never staked his family seat.
     has opened up his serving-trap.
     has painted for us the first snow
     has something low and unrefined.
     has taken on a silvery gleam;
     has voices that are more resounding,
     hate, love, joy, sorrow -- every feeling,
     have clearly got the upper hand
     have each asked him to a soirée:
     have other maidens, since you vanished,
     have vanished, like an empty noise,
     have you read lines of your creation
     have your fill of revelry!
     having by her severe demeanour
     having decyphered on their brow
     he arrives -- the cork goes flying up,
     He asks. She can't accept. Why ever?
     he carries her inside the door
     he changed the corvée of tradition
     he charged three roubles and a half,
     He cursed Theocritus and Homer,
     he danced attendance with the best;
     ``he dandled me as a small boy.
     He destined Olga's hand for me,
     he doesn't hear when I address
     He drained his glass down to the end
     he drinks -- all shout and take a swill;
     he ended even your employment;
     he even dares, once in a while,
     he eyes the door, looks slyly through.
     he failed to join that sharp profession
     he fed on hope's deceptive dinner;
     he fell in love with darkest wildwood,
     He finds the shock beyond all bearing:
     he fled from their resounding chatter!
     He followed them without illusion,
     he found all kinds of brickbat hurled.
     He found them in some old collection,
     He gave his arm. In sad abstraction,
     He gave this figure -- loved with passion,
     He gave three balls a year, and rather
     he had the talent of saluting
     he heard in stillness and in din
     he killed eight years in such a style,
     he knew too well that sort of scene.
     He lacked the slightest predilection
     he laughs -- they all begin to chuckle;
     he leaves a tender verse behind,
     he leaves the house, calls for his horse
     He looks, and answers: ``Agafon.''4
     he loves you... like your kith and kin!
     He mounts the sledge, with daylight fading:
     he never took one from the shelf,
     He nods -- they start to fuss and truckle;
     he reached the stream below the hill;
     he read, and read -- no satisfaction:
     He reads to Olga on occasion,
     he really forced one to admire him --
     he rested -- wept for by his neighbours,
     He roamed the world, his lyre behind him;
     He sang of grief and parting-time,
     he sang of lifetime's yellowed page --
     He sang of love, to love subjected,
     he saw that, as in cities, here
     He saw the sad girl's trembling state,
     he scowls -- and the whole gang are still;
     he sleeps, away from glare and glamour,
     He smiled as Lensky talked: the heady
     he stalked the drawing-rooms, remote
     he steers her, nonchalantly gliding,
     he stood there, pensive and forgetful,
     he stoops and, tenderly confiding,
     he strove to achieve the appropriation
     he struggled to bite back the chilling
     He sweetened up with fancy's icing
     he takes her to a chair, beginning
     he turns away: ``I've had enough --
     he wakes; a bath where ice is floating;
     He was a good and simple barin;6
     he was a menace, and a freak.
     he was a poet in his day.
     He was convinced, a kindred creature
     He was sweet-natured, and yet wild.
     He was too young to have been blighted
     He was without that dithyrambic
     he watched the guests and, as he dined,
     he whirls her through the wood... a hovel
     he who has cooled down love with parting,
     He who has lived and thought is certain
     He'd brought back all the fruits of learning
     he'd drink his coffee, flutter through
     He'd given up girls -- now gave up letters,
     he'd got annoyed, the tricky devil.
     he'd pop the poison in his chalice!
     he'd swim this Hellespont; then later
     he'll charm you with his fine invention,
     he'll spend before the looking-glass,
     he'll take you prisoner, you'll admire
     he's a freemason too; for him,
     He's always with her: either seated
     he's bowed politely; his attention
     he's dreadfully dissatisfied;
     he's first to toast her in the bowl,
     He's flown to Talon's,4 calculating
     he's gnawed by serpent Recollection,
     he's host, that's obvious. Thus enlightened
     he's lost his self-command, and crazed
     He's off -- this ruthless legislator
     he's put belle Tatiana instead.
     he's seen it all; with looks and fashion
     he's viewed the boxes without passion,

     hear, once more filled with inspiration,
     heartfelt, imploring, touching trash
     heaven's will -- for you I'm set apart;
     heeding the press, will make us look
     held in constraint by pity's touch:
     hell's terrifying imprecation:

     henceforth in front of you I weep,

     her clever husband on the morrow
     her darling foot of its wet shoe,
     her discomposure, her confusion,
     her drops of tears, and seated there,
     Her eyes were opened, and she said
     her face would pale, she'd start to quiver.
     Her father, kindly, well-regarded,
     Her feelings in their weary session
     her feelings were far more inclined --
     her fingers shake, she doesn't dare
     her girlhood games; in them he'd shared,
     her golden earrings off and whipping;
     her grief, and nearly ran away.
     her handkerchief has fallen too;
     her heart had long been overrun:
     her little friends, Tatyana'd yawn,
     her look, so sweetly sorrow-laden,
     her love obeys the laws of feeling,
     Her loving spouse with approbation
     her nerves, she leant on it her weight,
     her path a hare in headlong flight
     her progress at the masquerade.
     her Russian was as thin as vapour,
     her seal with its engraven crest.
     her soul was waiting... for someone.
     Her tender touch had never fingered
     her to the altar and the crown.
     her way; she passed, then as she walked
     her worth (but anathematising

     his serfs rejoicing at their lot.
     his sobs, where his live tears were flowing;
     his song was limpid in its tune
     his soul still blossomed out, and lighted
     his soul to a delicious rapture
     his soul with murmurs of distress.

     how many follies were engendered;
     how many lines of verse, and themes
     How many times I made a toy
     How often, when the sky was glowing,
     ``How slow you are at guessing, nyanya!''
     How soft his glance, or at discretion
     how they remind me of your stem,

     I'm old, my mind is blunted, Tanya;
     I'm sick, my dear, I'm sick indeed.
     I'm terrified -- so let it be...
     I've drawn a plan and a projection,

     in a melodious, flute-like tone.
     in a peaked cap, all dust and fluff, --
     in Adam Smith was his diploma;
     in all its mystery. Hymen's teasing,
     in all the world could take my heart!
     in any picture of this kind:
     In backwoods, how d'you pass this season?
     in britzkas, kibítkas and sleighs.
     in casual letters of confession --
     in corners whispering girls concur;
     in country towns and suchlike places
     in dark attire the new-born day.
     in darkest forest depths and drowned
     in darkness in her room, or treated
     In days of carefree aspirations,
     in deep anxiety of mind.
     in deepest grasses, quite alone,
     in deepest thought at the chess-board
     in dreams and cards and their prediction,
     in due succession; hers is lifted
     in fact a thorough fop, no less.
     in fact by some quite different thought.
     In fact one day a note came flying
     in father's or old uncle's book,
     in first place -- listen, am I right? --
     in flannel, and an old fur cap.

     in grief that nothing else could mend;
     In heart's affairs, a sweet beginner,

     in his defence, and smash it up;
     in his first dream of passion's fruit,
     in his small shack, will listen well
     in indescribable elation,
     in ink with colour-wash above;
     In languid silence, or the flame
     in lives that were just dawning then.
     In love with fame, by freedom smitten,
     in manifesting, as he could,
     in midst of trouble, storm or din.
     in music's own bewitching fashion
     in Olga everything expresses --
     in other things you come off best:
     in pairs, their hunger driving stronger,
     in play with her obedient doll
     in quilted coat, where rays were gleaming
     in Russian never found expression,
     in Russian winters thrilled at seeing
     in sensible old-fashioned style.
     in sheepskin coat with scarlet sash.
     in showing how to tell apart
     in sighs and boredom and deceits
     in silence all day she'd remain
     in sledded coaches and coupés,
     in stars upon the river-brink.

     In summertime -- for he was leading
     in taffeta of mourning black.
     in tears and violent tossing vented

     in the deep stillness of the night,
     in the expression of its being,
     in the full beauty of its frown;

     in the salon new faces meet,
     in the saloon, brocade-surrounded,
     In the two sisters' rooms extended,
     In the white heat of some dissension
     in their gay glass, the borrowed light
     in these last years all mixed and fluttered.

     its own perfection everywhere,
     its pristine charm: heeltaps, and leaps,

     Just facing Tanya's where they're sitting;
     ``Just half a glass more... that will do...
     Just let yourself be your whole care,
     just like a casual guest who might
     just like a shadow, or a wife.
     just like, on turf, your fleeting tread.
     just now of wrestling with his shade,
     just send your grandson on his way.''
     just sentries to each other calling,
     just what the nightmare signifies.
     kept asking: "shall I live to see"...''

     no beauties of a foreign clime,
     no brilliant truth, no vivid scene;

     no fuss; our belly has the power
     no glance so sweet, no sigh so teasing,
     No ice and flame, no stormy weather
     no longer does the herdsman chase
     No madrigals were for inscribing
     no magic fancies of the poet,
     no mansions, no ballrooms, no bards.
     no matter: hope, in child's disguise,
     no meaning in or out of season,
     No moralizing from this joker;
     no move she makes, no breath she draws;
     no noise of gaiety, no time
     no notice of them. But I've chattered
     no one was ever so engrossed:
     No one will think that worth gainsaying,
     No one's, I swear by God! in sadness
     No path to see: the snow has drifted
     No secret crimes, and no perditions,

     November stood outside the door.
     now a protruding branch assails her
     Now all was still. Tatyana slept.
     now as before, inside my breast;
     now dazzled by one thing's effulgence,
     now disenchanted with the next,
     ``Now don't suppose... let no suspicion...
     now even Didelot's tedious stuff.''
     now free, I once more weave together
     Now hear the friends in dialogue:
     Now here's a letter, as you see,
     now I've forgotten all I knew.
     Now Latin's gone quite out of favour;
     now Lovelace's renown has faded
     Now nearer... hooves... and in the yard
     now pay attention, I beseech,
     now sensitive, and now carefree,
     Now she's alarmed; in desperate worry
     Now Tanya's groaning, now she's sighing;
     Now that the British Muse is able
     Now the mazurka sounds. Its thunder
     now things are changed, now we resemble
     now, by green tablecloths awaited,
     Now, faced with this enormous revel,
     Now, Lensky, would it be so bad
     Now, she devours, with what attention,
     Now, to my cost it may be true
     ``Nurse, I'm not ill; I... I'm in love.''
     Nursed in the orient's languid weakness,
     O Adrian waves, my invocation;
     O Brenta, I'll see you in dream;
     o fields -- to you I'm vowed at heart.
     O flowers, and love, and rustic leisure,
          O rus!
          O Russia!
          O, never know these frightful dreams,
     Oak-floored, and simple as a stable:
     objective of his thoughts and joys:
     odd volumes from the devil's shelf,
     ``OE'' devotedly inlaced.
     of a delicious, guiltless dream...
     of any Bréguet: and in passing
     of ardent speech, that aching flow
     of aunts and mothers, and the thrall
     of blind Fortuna and of men
     of Bogdanóvich's11 refrains.
     of boiling youth did I desire
     of calculated slander should,
     of calm and reason, when the flame
     of certain ladies' tiny feet.
     of childish pranks: a chilled reaction
     of children, though as young as they,
     of course! you're bidden there next week.''
     Of course, the love of tender beauties,
     Of course. Yet fashion's wild rotation,
     of Dian's visage, in our fancies
     of eloquence, and just the same
     of entertaining the half-dead:
     of Eugene, cold as all creation,
     of evening, and those tears, the balm
     of every funeral far and wide;
     of fate, and life, each in its turn
     of goblets, tall and slender pretties;
     of gossip, and set comment humming
     of grammar, Russian language too.
     of Gulnare, he would play a card
     of happy love. For I have been
     of his intent; and a reaction
     of his Ochákov7 decoration!
     of hope and gloom, romantic-fashion,
     of hope is somehow still surviving
     of hope sometimes disturbs my heart;
     of house-familiars stands dismayed...
     of human friendship, holy men,
     of husband's friendship -- worst of all!
     of inexperience would have passed,
     of innocence: a lily blooming
     of instant thoughts, a fleeting trace
     of its unvarnished monochrome.
     of jealous girls, devote its strain?
     of jealousy has made her start,
     of jealousy, to seem to tremble
     of kindling smiles in ladies' eyes.
     of ladies and of freakish fops.
     of ladies' heads, and ladies' feet;
     of language which, so long ago,
     Of Lensky's fate they said no more --
     of light that flowering fields reflected:
     of listening like a judge-supreme
     of love's anxiety. Blessed is he
     of many distant lands he sang
     of mind got clarity new-found;
     of mocking turn, or else a breeder
     of moralistical persuasion,
     of neighbouring owners of the earth --
     of old-lime hospitality.
     of Olga: love's that kind of bore!
     of other's thought -- a splendid goal;
     of passion's out, and its whole manner
     of pity for my wretched state,
     of pity: in his silent bow,
     of plains where boredom reigns complete,
     of prejudice that's never been
     of raging passion's surge and roll
     of recompense beyond endurance,
     of Richardson and of Rousseau.
     of rugs, and carpets' rich refinement.
     of secret pain... but it's now rated
     of simple product supplements it.
     of something vague, some misty clime;
     of sudden brightness... it's too curious...
     of swooning, Tanya nearly dies;
     of tales of girls, and ghosts, and lore:
     of the cotillion's endless theme
     of the dull shores of my disfavour,
     of the most harmless, hopeless trash.
     of the Terpsichorean foot.
     of the two girls; their premonition
     of time between the wolf and dog.)
     of trumpet, dagger, mask and sword,
     of useful objects that the curious
     of virgin fancy, and again
     of waiting for the dawn to blush,

     Olga's adorer comes a-wooing.
     Olga's appeared upon the scene,
     Olga's no life in her regard:
     Olinka and her mother sent:
     Olinka yawned, just like her neighbour,
     Omens dismayed her with their presage;
     on a fast stallion from the Don,
     on a small bench by Tanya's bed,
     on a small table's oilcloth sheen
     on ballroom's looking-glass parquet
     on dance-floor, at breakup of ball,
     on dining-chairs are all prostrated;
     on Eugene, he was deeply stirred:
     on features known, but to that dreary,
     on Finland's coast a lonely rover --
     on foot, by seven o'clock, until
     on goose's neck, a skull looks cheerful
     on her smug face a flush of pleasure.
     on jam, and speeches in regard
     on kennels, and on kith and kin,
     on liquor, and on hay brought in,
     on me, all this has no effect:
     on most occasions between friends,
     on Olga; from heart's ache still spared,
     (on orders which of course presume
     on points that all long since agree --
     on Richardson gone raving mad.
     on springtime grasses of the field,
     on stage are thumping without cease;
     on the cotillion, as amends.
     on the dull life that bachelors lead;
     On the first sheet you'll find a question:
     on the highroad the wolves come out;
     On the seashore, with storm impending,
     on this unstable life, my friends!
     on tragedy; but it's no joke,
     on unknown ladies in the tiers;
     on visits to us, and in greeting
     on waves of far niente floated,
     On whom alone can we depend?
     on words of foreign derivation,
     once I too liked it very much;
     once more Corneille's majestic story;
     once more that touch is fiercely troubling
     once more the love, once more the smart...
     once on the highway he'd detected
     once, with its foaming and its playing,
     one customary grief each hour!
     one customary object gleaming,
     one day came down that lonely turning,
     one finds in war amusing sport,
     one leads the multitude in thought,
     one pair! I pay them memory's tribute
     one raves in verse like me, and one
     one sees a duck and aims his gun,
     one smoothes the pillows down in bed,
     one thing inspired his breath, his heart,
     one wallows in delicious weeping;
     Onegin has outrun us all.
     Onegin knew enough to savour
     Onegin sits at table too,
     Onegin spoke about its flights
     Onegin swiftly came to know
     Onegin too. ``Good Lord, at last!''
     Onegin was assessed by many
     Onegin's life, you see, was holy;
     Onegin, my good friend, was littered
     only in January the snow,

     Only the ode, that solemn story!

     Right at the outset of my story
     right from the cradle of her days;

     roofs, flowerbeds, fences, all in white,
     roses romantically blowing;
     round Tanya congregate the misses,
     Rousseau (forgive a short distraction)
     runs after what is sweet, and vain.

     scarlet with passion's instant flaring,

     she calls down curses on their leisure,
     she can't escape at any pace --
     she can't make out a single fraction
     she can't; and in her panic hurry
     she can't; Evgeny's pushed the portal,
     she did what nurse advised she do
     She dreamt of portents. In her dreaming
     She dropped... ``It's he! Eugene arriving!
     she fell in love -- the hour was fated...
     she fell in love with all the fancies
     she finds, in order alphabetic:
     she flails around, she tries to shout --
     she flies as fast as she can go;
     she flies no more, she's lost her strength.
     She folds the page, lays down the plume.,
     she found Evgeny, eyes a-glitter,
     she found, in labours and in leisure,
     she grew accustomed, and contented.
     She hates a friendly voice's sound,
     she lacked her sister's beauty, lacked
     she looks, the room is getting light --
     She loved the balcony, the session
     she lowers darkened eyes, unwitting,
     she never joined, or skipped, but rather
     she never read a Russian paper,
     she peers discreetly through a chink
     she quite forgot -- began to call
     she sat there; through her teeth a word
     she saw no friendly figure starting
     she sighed, and in a trance coopted
     she sits with head sunk on her breast,
     she speeds her footsteps to a race,
     she spins and, friend of winter nights,
     she stopped at the loud torrent's bound,
     she trembles, and with fever drumming
     she walked across a snowy plain
     she walked, but just as she was turning
     She was alone, lit by the moon.
     She was like him and always sported
     ``She was the one who looked as still
     she wrote in French... what a confession!
     she yields to it without condition
     she'd never join the game selected,
     she'd never tell them news or scandal
     she'll spin this way and that, and beat
     She's dressed since dawn, dead pale; debating,
     She's dropped her sash's silken billow;
     She's fallen in the snow -- alertly
     She's in the wood, the bear still trails her.
     ``She's mine!'' Evgeny's voice of thunder
     she's nearly swooned, she's suffocating;
     She's paid the sunrise no attention,
     she's up and flying through the air

     still captivated his young soul.
     still coughing, hissing, clapping, champing;
     still everywhere the lamps are bright;
     still filled with Eugene, Tanya wrote,
     Still in the porch, exhausted-stupid,
     Still on the board, the beakers hissed,
     still shivering in the bitter weather
     Still tumbling, devil, snake and Cupid

     such rustic cunning can't be wrong!) --
     such shadowy and leisured ways,
     such stubborn brain, and vivid will,
     Such were a young rake's meditations --

     Tanya thanks each one with a phrase.

     Tanya's no longer quite so frightened
     Tanya's undressed, and lies in bed.
     Tatyana breathed on the cold pane,
     Tatyana dear, with you I'm weeping:
     Tatyana flushed, and started shaking.
     Tatyana groaned above the tide;
     Tatyana had a changeling look
     Tatyana had no dolls to dandle,
     Tatyana heard Evgeny out.
     Tatyana in low-cut attire
     Tatyana listened with vexation
     Tatyana looks with pulses racing
     Tatyana looks, her faintness passes:
     Tatyana lowered her regard
     Tatyana never knew the attraction
     Tatyana now need wait no longer.

     Tatyana'd rise by candlelight.

     Tatyana's rites are not for me.
     Tatyana, hunted by love's anguish,
     Tatyana, lonely heroine,
     Tatyana, sleepless in the dark,
     Tatyana3 was her name... I own it,
     ``Tell me, our neighbours, are they thriving?
     ``Tell me, what's your companion doing?''
     than households where the wife must moan
     than most. Evgeny, though he knew
     than what our sorrowing rhymesters do?
     thank God, he had no inclination
     thank him by curtseying to the dust;
     that alien scene must I now turn
     that all of Russia can't contribute
     that ardent youth entirely lacks;
     that corps of social legislation --
     that even so my wretched style
     that fell, and then began to shiver,
     that fills him and in which he lives.
     that fired his soul, to burn the same;
     that from the backdoor he'd be leaving
     that generations of new beauties,
     (that half-pay archivist); and bounding
     that huge ballrooms vibrated under,
     that I prefer to Champagne's tide;
     that I'm just longing to indite --
     that in the usual Christmas scrimmage
     that inexperience leads to grief.''
     That isn't our immediate worry:
     that king of the satiric scene,
     that languid beauty, listens nicely --
     that Menelaus was quite right --
     that modish rings were still a-buying.
     that moment, of a luscious pie
     that night, in secret, set for two;
     that not a syllable be uttered
     that nubile maid of riper age,
     that once I spent my happiest days?
     That point I wouldn't mind contesting,
     that poison brew; and in your mind
     that queen of secrets and of sighing.
     that raves with poetry can ever
     that rogue, backbiter, pantaloon,
     that sat above the stove and purred
     that self-same evening where he'd go.
     that she's so trustful, and imbued
     that stretched from Romulus in his prime
     that there be just one voice which came,
     < that there existed, for the indulgence
     that there his friend Kavérin's5 waiting;
     that thievish mouths cannot consume
     that this of all things for a swain
     that verse will turn to useful duties;
     that virgin dream and its confession
     that visitors must be expected.
     that was less clever still by half.
     that world where every man's a critic
     That year the season was belated
     that youthful soul, which pined for sadness;
     that's the refrain that you should sing,
     That's when I'll sit down to compose
     that's where my years of youth were spent.
     that, artless, and without concealing,
     that, like proud Byron, I can draw
     that, meanwhile, pinched and glum of feature,
     the abstracted poet would bring forth
     the album of a country miss
     the allée to the lake, the copse;
     the ancients have gone stiff and cold,
     the ardent author of the past
     the art he'd studied best of all,
     the atmosphere of youth and madness,
     the audience still is busy stamping,
     the ballroom drove me off my head:
     The banquet's given no cause for sneezing,
     the barbs that envy's always spreading,
     the bear -- what next? -- behind her stalked.
     the bear explains: ``my cousin's here --
     the bear has raised her in his paws;
     the bear let out a roar, and held
     the best revenge one could desire.
     The better to dispel her sorrow
     The bitterness was mine -- the ice
     the bleeding tongues, the tufted tails,
     the blood within my withered heart,
     The book displayed, not so you'd know it,
     the boxes; boiling, pit and stalls;
     the branches all are weighted down
     the brilliant crackpot: this reaction
     the cabinet behind the door
     The censor's tribute, I'll arrange:
     The château was of a construction
     the charge that poets are unable
     the charm of what was grave and plain.
     the child prepares for protocol --
     The city's early sounds awake her;
     the clamorous honking geese began
     the coachmen ring the fire, and curse
     the cold perfection of the sky,
     the coolness of the sombre glade,
     the Corsair, or the Wandering Jew.
     the country's pretty stupid here!
     the crash of plates and knives is blended
     the crown of marriage was projected
     the crush, the glitter and the gladness,
     the cunning prisoner can quite well
     the darling objects -- don't you know it? --
     the darling sex is light as down.
     the days grew shorter, in the glade
     the deeper in the wood, the more
     the draught whose blessings are agreed,
     the driver sits and cuts a dash
     the eager players are enrolled --
     the easier they become to charm,

     The evening passes, and meanwhile
     the expanse of fields, so wide, so lonely,
     the eyes of all, the hooves, the snozzles,
     the fateful diet; by depression
     the fear and rage with which I foam!
     the festal name day has begun.
     The fields are dark, since evening came.
     The fire was dying; cinders faintly
     the flaming roses of a cheek,
     the fleeting tenderness that stole
     the fleeting works of my creation,
     The flirt has reason's cool volition;
     the floor serves Triquet for his nap,
     the flower-like pallor of the maiden,
     the footmen sleep on the pelisses;
     the foreign words a maiden's passion
     the friends' salute she never hears
     the full fruit of her heart's desire;
     the funeral monument explains:
     the gallery claps -- it's bored with waiting --
     the gift of recognizing what
     the girl remains there in the gloom
     the girl's pale charms, her loosened hair,
     the girls sing out the ancient rhyme:
     the grey-haired nurse with kerchiefed head;
     the guardian angel of tradition,
     the guests are feasted, good and hearty,
     the guests squeeze closer to the centres;
     The hall is full of noise and hustle,
     the hapless Phrygians all the same,
     The happiness of youth is dead,
     the hare who from afar has seen
     the heart of the professional flirt!
     the heartache that they bring lies deep.
     The hearth was low beyond all stoking.
     the heavenly lights in glorious quire
     the herdsman's horn proclaimed the morning
     the hero's name's decided too.
     the highest circles are a bore.
     the homely scene, take pleasure in it --
     the horns, and the moustachio'd nozzles --
     the horrid nightmare must portend
     the horse gets wind of them and, snorting,
     the horses fidget worse and worse;
     the hostess cries and, moving fast,
     The house is packed out; scintillating,
     the hunter in the wood will swear
     the idol that she'll most admire
     The illness with which he'd been smitten
     the indifferent, or the deadly serious!
     the jams appear in little dishes;
     the jug of bilberry wine is seen.1
     the kiss where youth and freshness gleam;
     the ladies' calculated dress;
     The Larins kept the old tradition:
     the latest fashions of the town;

     the legatee of his relations --
     the letter from Tatyana's hand:
     the letter trembles in her grip;

     The protocol is all one wishes:

     the regimental band is coming,
     the rogue has got a finger frozen:
     the rosy bloom that glowed so newly
     the rosy sealing-wafer's drying
     the roundest face that you've set eyes on,
     the Russian N, like N in French;
     The rustic sage, in that apartment,
     the safest place for declarations,
     the samovar of evening boiled,
     the season which is such a bore --
     the secret of her husband's measure,
     the secrets of the grave, the pages
     the shades of night within their keeping
     the shady wood, the talking stream;
     the silence when our talk had ceased!
     the simple faith of olden days
     The sky breathed autumn, time was flowing,
     The sky is clear, the earth is frozen;
     the skyblue eyes, the flaxen tresses,
     the sober head, detesting each
        The Song of the Girls
     the stars, the moon -- celestial light
     the strain of Tasso's octave-rhyme!
     the strophe over which I slaved;
     the subtle spouse was just as loyal --
     the sufferings of tempestuous passion;
     the sumptuous palais shines out;
     the talk of guests when they appear;
     the third day, wood and hill and grazing
     the thought of volatile renown.
     the thought sank in, and penetrated:
     the thoughts of my two anchorites.
     the threshold's thronged, wet-nurses call,
     the tighter we can stretch above them
     the tolerant Evgeny heard --
     The tomcat, mannered and affected,
     the tongue of love and of Petrarch.
     the total ownership of woods,
     the tusks, the corpse's finger-nails,
     the uncertainties within his heart;
     the units are ourselves alone.
     the universe is all perfection;
     the unmetric verses of tradition
     the unworthy husband through depressing
     the urn of perfumed tea, and tipping
     the usurers' voracious tribe.
     the utter virtue of their being,
     The vote was passed without demur.
     the whole thieves' kitchen flies asunder,
     the wilful fancies of the heart.
     the wine-addict adores the cup:
     The World found this enough to treat
     the world's éclat, its thunder-roll,
     The yard was bursting with dependants;
     the youthful lover once again
     their breed would (some years after this)
     their guests, for all they ate and drank,
     their hand to grapple slander's cup,
     their joyous way across the ice;
     their looks and language in deceit
     their lords, and thwack their palms together;
     their masters' berries undetected
     their southward flight: one saw approaching
     Their talk, so sound on every matter,
     their tendency to call, and sit.
     then afterwards, alone, at ease,
     Then doors are opened, Lensky enters,
     then dress...
     then from his cabinet he'll pass
     then from the Muse there came revival:
     then he began to talk once more
     then he presents her with the scroll.
     then he'd implore a declaration,
     then I'd have looked for you alone
     then Lensky moved his pawn, and took,
     then liking grew, then every day
     then night comes on; the moon's patrolling
     then on the leaves of recollection,
     ``Then send your grandson with this letter
     then sudden fear attacked Tatyana...
     then suddenly she's off, and there
     then to the altar, to be crowned.
     Then verdicts from her husband's quartet
     Then what resulted from the meeting?
     Then with a half-ethereal splendour,
     Then, after midday he'll be waking;
     then, country evening fast arriving,
     Then, crying, they untwined my plait,
     then, help me God, she caterwauls:
     then, on the last page, the suggestion:
     Then, plunged in the housekeeper's day,
     then, stepping nearer, Eugene said:
     there сzerov8 shared the unwilling
     there any friend of harmless pleasure
     there caustic Shakhovskóy8 came in
     there Didelot10 crowned himself with glory:
     there gathered at the coffin-side
     There once I too strolled back and forth:
     There too, he honoured, hotly weeping,
     there waited for us both the malice
     there was a general furtive chatter,
     There was a period when cold-blooded
     there was a softness in his glance:
     There you're entirely sure of finding
     there'll be a fight. For that I give
     there's a small window shining in it,
     there's crashing, rumbling, pounding, trotting,
     there's far too much of contradiction,
     there's no absurdity as such,
     there's no ignoble tale that seems
     there's nothing can employ her anguish,
     There's powdery snow up to her knees;
     there's yap of pugs, and laughs, and bustle;
     there, where the coulisse entrance went,
     These figures from the world of seeming,
     these words are not of Russian stock:
     they all have richly earned a pension;''
     they all have swarmed into the hall,
     they buried Uncle, congregated
     They buzz -- but then all talk's suspended --
     they don't deserve what they inspire
     they heap up silver with a spade;
     they leave their shores and fly away.
     they met on horseback; quickly they
     they needed kvas like air; at table
     they rise and ripen and fall dead:
     They should be forced to read in Russian,
     they shove each plate, and every chair,
     They sing; unmoved by their sweet-sounding
     they sit, they cross themselves for grace.
     they took offence at this, and broke
     they were her only food... and so
     they while away the morning's calm.
     They will receive us with delight.''
     they'd just enrage it with their dart.
     they'd settled that some years before.
     they're all chained up in different fetters,
     they're on the dance-floor, waltzing, spinning.
     they're plunging, whirling, all but squatting.
     they've moved around and been reseated;
     this child of luxury and delight.
     this denizen of the coulisses
     this Grandison of hers was splendid,
     ``this is the one!'' Ah, ever stronger,
     this soul that glowed with virgin fire.
     ``This time I think you've been reduced to
     this was our heroes' conversation
     this was the science of that passion
     This work of the profoundest learning
     Those friends, those friends! it is, I fear,
     those monkeys of the good old days:
     those walks amid the gloom and calm
     those words where love, without condition,
          thou, my Svetlana!
     Though belles had lost his adoration,
     though cold I am and sad; in sleep
     though Menelaus, in Helen's name,
     though we... don't shine in any way,
     though years ago I used to look
     thought them a pointless peccadillo;
     thought, day and night, and thought again
     thoughts of a girl, or as the moon
     threats, vows, and simulated fears,
     three pairs of handsome ones -- yet there
     Three whole hours, at the least accounting,
     Thronged by adorers, I've detected
     through distant regions of the heart...
     through gloom and mist; and there came streaming
     through heaven's expanse serenely flying,

     through it they're known to me, and kin.

     till then had been dispersed and wasted --

     to all the most adored actrices,
     to all this tattle, yet at heart
     to ask of you that you transcend
     to be respected all through life:
     to be the bride I'd call my own.
     to bee and butterfly unknown.
     to bellow out: ``she's mine, she's mine.''
     to blow his brains out, but in stead
     to catch the eye and to attract.
     to comfort her in all her woes,
     to demonstrate some signs of reason:
     to do them all is easy game.
     to drive the swooning senses mad;
     to drown the hiss of modish wives.
     to eat and drink, then separated
     to ensure that till next time our image
     to Eugene all was new and thrilling;
     to Eugene; nineteen to the dozen,
     to Evgeny. Oh, God, she'd never...
     to freedom, softness and enjoyment:
     to garden walks, as arm in arm
     to gasp, and on a bench to sink.
     to gentlemen on every side
     To harmless idleness devoted,
     to hear what latest modes require,
     to help her from the other side;
     to hide a hope, to make a show
     to high renown my doleful story,
     to his disputing and his cursing;
     to hope that even once a week
     to horror-stories told at night
     to institute a new regime.
     to kiss Armida's lips, or seek
     to kissing or caressing father
     to know the audience hears his voice.
     to know you, swooned, and in a second
     to lie down at her feet like slaves!
     to life and hope with just a glance --
     to life grew colder than the dead.
     to lift her skirt up; still she's flying,
          To live, it hurries, and to feel it hastes.
     to liven with a silk atour
     to look like sad romanticism.

     To me, unsmiling lips bring terror,
     to meet a black monk, or if crossing
     to mourn for Russia's gloomy savour,
     To my astonishment I've seen her,
     to my young days, it's time I turned
     to nobody except a wizened
     to pass for cultured in our ranks.
     to pass the evening. No? then tot
     to pass the time was Eugene's theme:
     to play with a dishevelled tress,
     To private tastes we each subscribe:
     to put on chains for him, and steady
     to puzzle out with some precision
     to rains, and flax, and the stockyard.''
     to save the honour of our land
     to scorn the men with whom he deals;
     to see my kin, and in the end
     to sing of others must imply
     to sleep some black and empty dreams;
     to smother her dear feet with kissing.
     to speak; believe me: of my shame
     to tales that young moustachios tell.
     to talk of this and that, but then
     to Tanya, all's an empty show.
     to the beginning of our days.
     to the circle of our dance.
     to the first meanings of his flute.
     to the hero that she'd adopted.
     to the Larins' had caused a spout
     to undertake their resurrection,
     to us, though, not exactly new.
     to vice, while virtue got its crown.
     to which so oft we've dedicated
     to whisper it her inmost prayer.
     To whom do you, from all the train
     to whom your hearts are dedicated,
     to wiser words and deeds, and learned
     to wreak, by stirring Lensky's ire,
     to wreck a maiden's sleep with fable,
     to your loved ones? They do maintain
     Today a mental fog enwraps us,
     ``Today he promised he'd be here,''
     together they arrived, and none

     too weak to change, I'm staying vicious,

     unseen, already you were dear,

     until the dawn beneath her pillow.
     until the grave by your strong hand:
     until the tombstone; there one day
     until this day, a lady's love
     untirable, at sound of drum:
     untouched by envy's bitter smarting,
     up the hillside at breakneck pace;
     Up to the porch our hero's driven:
     up your accounts, and raging, toping,
     upon her feverish tongue; the slip
     upon her lips the breathing dies,
     upon it, and with head down-bent

     Vladimir Lensky, whose creator
     Vladimir Lensky. Quick, let's dine!
     Vladimir, wealthy and good-looking,
     wakened at the same hour of night
     walked homeward round the kitchen garden;
     Walking? The country that you roam
     wanders in a distracted way
     was an enchanting country nook:
     was asked around as quite a catch --
     was brought there by a huckster who
     was by forebodings much oppressed.
     was Göttingen, his alma mater,
     was his; we'd both drunk passion's chalice:
     Was it for you that I became
     Was it not in such sweet employment
     was it not you, dear apparition,
     Was it to no effect that he,
     was just created for the part.
     was quite beyond his wit, we found.
     was still mysterious and enticing --
     was stripped away, and mists encroaching
     was younger still, but at that stage
     watch the games we maidens play.''
     We all meandered through our schooling
     We each enjoy a special hobby,
     We each have enemies in this world,
     we have to cherish and admire
     We must confess that taste deserts us
     we sometimes like to hear again
     We too shall find our hour is waiting;
     we visit them, or without fail
     we were swept off, in reverie's haze,
     we'd better hasten to the ball,
     we'll draw it deeper in our net;
     we'll keep love's price appreciating,
     We've many neighbours round about;
     wedlock for us would be abhorrent.
     ``Well, I won't hold you up or bore you;

     were you in love when you were young?''
     What breasts! What soul!... We'll go one day
     what came from this unlooked-for meeting;
     what can one do? as said above,
     What else? Quite drunk with love's illusion,
     what flowers of spring display your dint?
     what have your wits to do with me?
     ``What in the world is more distressing
     what it's transported to our shore
     ``What nonsense, Tanya! in those other
     what occupied his chafing powers
     what odes Vladimir might have written --
     What of it? it's euphonious, pleasant,
     What of it? Nothing. I'm just sending
     ``What of them, Tanya? I was able,
     What sort of roses, in your notion,
     what traps he'd set him, with what malice
     What? Invitations? Yes, three houses

     whatever you may need, just call...
     when Bréguet's chime is heard proclaiming
     When comes my moment to untether?
     When Eugene's turn for salutation
     when little notes come on a tray.
     when not quite eighteen years of age.
     When out to burst a rival's bubble,
     when shall I start on my escape?
     when we begin to talk of verse);
     When we draw a fellow in,
     when we see him from afar,
     When we've retreated to the banner
     "When will the devil come for you?"''
     when, from behind the doorway, hidden
     when, in pale sky, the stars' procession
     when, utterly worn out by rhyming,
     Whenever nyanya had collected
     Where are you? come -- and my own right
     where he was master of his college,
     where in the heart of silence rang
     where scribbling friends have interjected
     where shall he go, my rogue, my hearty?
     where Tanya now confronts Eugene.
     where the prize-boy of fashion's college
     where you were born as well, I think,
     where, in a cab, and furious hurry,
     which held him silently subjected,
     which I myself won't praise or blame
     ``Which neighbour, dear? My head became
     Which one comes first? It's just the same
     which Ovid sang, for which the bard,
     which smilingly your friend, supported
     which with a blush he leaves unread.
     which, listening with some condescension,
     while a mazurka holds the crowd;
     while dear Tatyana's youth grows dimmer:
     while floors would split from crash of heel,
     while in the hut a girl is singing;
     while odes have high and noble aims...''
     while Petersburg's already rousing,
     while roar of violins contrives
     while serious topics were disputing,
     While under the connubial banner
     whisper of breeze announces morning,
     whisper repeated to the crone.
     whispered by heart a note addressed
     whispers some ballad of the hour,
     who can combine it with the free
     who else? -- the hero of our novel!
     who in the dark came flashing through
     Who is there who will truly measure
     who late at night are whirled away
     ``who loves you more than I, let's see
     who on a deuce, that famous cheat,
     who sets me snoring then and there --
     Who taught her all this mad, slapdash,
     Who taught her an address so tender,
     who was it that you dreamt about?''
     who'd sit, and at the end of play
     who'll clap an entrechat, or scoff
     Who'll never fault our vices, or
     Who'll sow no calumnies around us?
     Who's not disgusted by cajoling,
     whom shall we never find a bore?
     Whom then to credit? Whom to treasure?
     whom thirty centuries have adored!
     Whose fond attentions will astound us?
     ``Whose glance, provoking inspiration,
     whose heart experience has cooled
     whose kindly hand will ruffle down
     whose memory will preserve for me
     whose serfs are miserably thin;
     ``Why did you visit us, but why?
     why fight what's known to be decisive?
     Why have you gone all pale and queasy?''
     Why is Tatyana guiltier-seeming?
     ``Why not?'' ``I'd choose the other quarter
     why, at the thought, my husband's mother
     Why, pretty one, you're up already!
     ``Why, Tanya, what...?'' ``All's dull and trifling.
     wild as a forest deer, and fearful,
     Wildly the fearful laughter pealed;
     will disappear as fast as smoke:
     will find the ice elude his grip
     will in a flash decide his lot.
     will in my soul be hushed and dying.
     will loyally discharge its duties,
     wine of the Comet6 fills the cup;
     Winter!... The countryman, enchanted,
     wished him to come and say farewell.
     with a blunt cue for the duration,
     with a small tray and a teacup.
     with a Venetian maiden who
     with all our hearts, and who require
     with amber pipes from Tsaregrad;12
     with an avowal just as artless;
     with an obeisance I'll hand over...
     with any torture so exquisite
     with balm of prayer my torn and rended
     with bended knees a windmill dances,
     with brilliant conquests by the shower,
     with broods of children of all ages,
     with bursts of passion from the heart,
     with careful schemes of decoration
     with cause that I've recalled them here.
     with censure -- I've done all to earn it!
     with charming forefinger she traced
     with combs, and steel utensils serving
     with comedies of swarm and din;
     with cranium aching fit to split;
     with custom, love would fade away;
     with deep emotion through and through,
     with demoiselles of riper age;
     with draughts from love's enticing flask,
     with each nuance of wintry glow:
     with Eugene proved a tempting prize.
     with every different kind of rabble...''
     with eyes aflame Onegin rises
     with fond caress? whose adoration
     with fright, she hears the approaching bear;
     with grave goodbyes to the bereaved,
     with heart that's grown unused to praise,
     with irresistible refulgence,
     with jealousy beyond all measure
     with lampions studded all about
     with lines to mark where they were sleeping...
     with lively and pellucid look,
     with love and comfort in your meaning,
     with me to see an alien strand;
     with mournful sound the secret shade
     with Olga, all have pierced her soul;
     with our Mamas, and a sensation
     with our poor girl was kind and good;
     with passion and with shrewd obliqueness
     with perturbation and with worry;
     with pleasure on his vengeful act.
     with sabre's slash, and bullet's blast.
     with scorn to make my world a hell.
     with sheer enchantment fills her cup!
     with shelves of books deployed for action,
     with sighs unconsciously regretful.
     With spelling scrambled to perdition,
     with spinning noise and senseless flashing
     with storm and tumult in his head,
     with such a blissful, brief infection --
     with tenderness he'd watched and noted
     with the pink glow the snows assume
     with the resounding chime of glass.
     with The Well-Meaner10 on her knee?
     with this the hero of my tale:
     with thoughts of him in ceaseless round.
     with three roan horses in a line
     with Tolstoy's2 brush, or decorated
     with trees decked in their silvery kit,
     with tufts of snow; and through the lifted
     with whom your thoughts are so obsessed --
     With womankind, the less we love them,
     with young Semyónova,9 and there
     with your good offices, and so
     within her bosom to abate,
     without a trace of spite or plot,
     without a word Tatyana leant
     without preliminary feeler
     Without romance, or false insistence,
     won't benefit these guts of mine.''
     won't even cross their minds by stealth...
     word on his lips, and thought: it's sheer
     words mispronounced, thoughts ill-expressed
     would be allied to him by fate;
     would bless the form his fortune took.
     would fill Tatyana from afar
     would have been spared this laceration.
     would Hymen bring us -- blooms that might
     would launch into self-sacrifice;
     would leave her dithering and tossing.
     would on those evenings guess the fate
     would say goodbye and drive away,
     wronged always in disgraceful fashion --

     years back, to call up many a fable;
     yes, even there its triumph grows.
     yes, focus on them your lorgnette,
     Yes, spleen was waiting like a sentry,
     yes, these were our forefathers' ways,
     Yes, youth divines, in giddy madness,
     Yet -- fear itself she found presented
     yet a capricious inclination,
     yet floods of talk around the town...
     yet he fell out of love at last
     yet he'd back you through thick and thin:
     Yet hissing froth deals a malicious,
     yet how I wish that I might raise
     yet people's malice and suspicion
     Yet sweeter far, at such a time,
     Yet Tanya's note made its impression
     Yet the mazurka keeps today
     yet, as each rule has its exception,
     yet, truthfully and not in chaff,
     you called there twice, and since then took
     you drink the magic draught of yearning,
     you find the country godforsaken;
     you gave me such a shocking fright!
     You husbands, deeply I respect you!
     you kept your friendship with our friend:
     you know I'm hard to comprehend...
     ``You know, it's true, how I attended,
     you learn life's sweetness, and with this
     you left no steps that could be tracked:
     you loved the opulent contact
     you made me drunk as one could ask!
     you newborn work, and like a winner
     you object of my guileless ditties!
     ``You pile one eclogue on another!
     you see your fated tempter stand.
     you too have seen on Neva's brink.
     You too, mamas, I pray attend it,
     You too, prime beauties in your flower
     you were the first ones he forswore;
     ``You wrote to me, and nothing spoken
     ``You yawn, Onegin?'' ``As I'm used to.''
     you'd made appearance in my dreaming;
     you'd not so much as know the name,
     You'll love again, but you must teach
     you'll never leave me to my fate.
     you'll read: here's Pradt,7 here's Walter Scott!
     you'll recognize him soon enough, --
     you're all in fever... heavens above.''
     ``You're ill, God have you in his keeping,
     ``You're off? why, there's a poet for you!''
     you're really going? Well, I'm sad.
     you're sure to find her portrait in it:
     ``You're wrong.'' ``But what I wonder at
     you've made so many secret rhymes,
     Young ladies jump for future blisses...
     your battles, lawless and atrocious,
     your chorus, is it dead for ever?
     Your curiosity is burning
     your dashing one, is she surviving?''
     your early life, unlock your tongue:
     your grief would fail to touch my heart,
     your heart some self-restraint; for each
     your heels will squash the ladies' toes! >
     your heroes, raging and ferocious,
     Your horse, blunt-shoed and all unwary,
     your loved one, honourable reader!
     ``Your modish world, I'll do without it;
     your molten gold, your charmed infusion;
     your night of fretting's left no trace!
     your tears would flow -- but your emotion,
     your Zeus, your Cypris, your whole band
     youth is a fever; we must spare
     youth which has nothing to regret,
     youth's choice, the flower of French cuisine:
           Zhukovsky
     Zizi, my crystal and my gem,
